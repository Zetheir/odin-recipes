<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Saltimbocca, is an Italian dish. It's name literally means "to jump in your mouth", probably because it tastes so good it jumps into your mouth! 
    
    It consists of veal that has been wrapped ("lined") with prosciutto and sage and then marinated in wine, oil or salt water, depending on the region or one's own taste.

    I learned this recipe from a really good chef that is famous in Brazil. She makes the most delicious dishes, and probably you'll appreciate this one too!

<ul>
    <li>Pig filet mingon (or a similar cut of pig)</li>
    <li>Prosciutto (or ham)</li>
    <li>Fresh sage</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>White wine</li>
    <li>Capers</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Olives</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Cut the pig in small sizes, cut diagonally against the meat.</li>
    <li>Wrap the cuts in some sheets of paper and hammer them with a meat hammer until they're really thin.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper. But in one of the sides, add significantly less salt. In that side, put the sage leaves.</li>
    <li>Put prosciutto on top of said sages, so it looks like a "sage sandwich". Make sure pig and proscuitto are the same size.</li>
    <li>Skewer the meat with toothpicks, coming in on one side and coming out in the same side, so the prosciutto sticks to the pig.</li>
    <li>In the prosciutto-less side, sprinkle some flour.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, add 100g butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Fry the meat.</li>
    <li>Make sure to heat the plate that will serve the saltimboccas with hot water. When it's hot enough and when the saltimboccas are fried, take out the water and put the saltimboccas.</li>
    <li>In the frying pan we used, add white wine and capers. Mix it until it "cleans" the frying pan from the pig's juices.</li>
    <li> Take out the toothpicks, add the sauce, and serve.</li>
