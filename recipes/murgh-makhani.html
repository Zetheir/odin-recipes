    <li>On a frying pan, add 100g of butter and fry the chicken for 10mins. Not a lot of time, beacuse we will cook it again. If the pan has too much liquid, reserve it in another bowl.</li>

    <li>Fry the onions, the sliced tomatoes and - after lightly smashing them - the brazil nuts.</li>

    <li>Add the sauce you took out from the chicken cubes. If even then the pan is too dry, add water.</li>
    <li>Half cover the pan with a lid and let it sit for 10mins in medium heat.</li>
    <li>Blend the sauce in a blender.</li>
    <li>Add more 50g of butter on the last used frying pan. Add the sauce from the blender.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken cubs in said sauce and let them cook inside the sauce.</li>
